# Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Overview
This section covers essential prompt engineering techniques that enhance productivity when working with AI tools like GitHub Copilot. These techniques will help you generate more accurate, useful, and contextually appropriate code and documentation for your projects.

## Key Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought
**Description**: Break down complex problems into sequential, logical steps to guide the AI through a reasoning process.

**Benefits**:
- Improves accuracy of complex solutions
- Makes the AI's reasoning process more transparent
- Helps avoid logical errors in generated code

**Example Format**:
```
Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, we need to [first logical step]
2. Next, we'll [second logical step]
3. Finally, we can [final step to reach solution]
```

### 2. X-Shot Prompting
**Description**: Provide one or more examples (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot) to establish patterns for the AI to follow.

**Types**:
- **Zero-shot**: No examples provided
- **One-shot**: Single example provided
- **Few-shot**: Multiple examples provided

**Benefits**:
- Establishes clear patterns for the AI to follow
- Improves consistency in generated outputs
- Particularly effective for domain-specific tasks

**Example Format**:
```
Format data in the following way:
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output format]

Now format this: [actual input]
```

### 3. Role Prompting
**Description**: Assign a specific role or expertise to the AI to frame its responses within that context.

**Benefits**:
- Provides implicit context and knowledge framing
- Encourages responses aligned with specific expertise
- Useful for domain-specific requirements

**Example Format**:
```
Act as a [role/expert], and help me [task description]
```

### 4. Specific Context Prompting
**Description**: Provide detailed context about the specific project, requirements, constraints, or frameworks being used.

**Benefits**:
- Generates more tailored and relevant responses
- Reduces need for additional clarifications
- Improves first-time quality of generated code

**Example Format**:
```
I'm working on a [project type] using [technologies/frameworks]. The project requires [specific requirements]. Generate [requested output].
```

## Practical Implementation

### For Backend Development (Java/Spring Boot)
Use these techniques to:
- Generate entity models for telecommunications billing systems
- Create RESTful controllers for invoice management
- Implement service layers with appropriate business logic
- Design database schemas and repositories for invoice data

Reference the code lab in the Java folder for specific examples of these techniques applied to a telecommunications billing system.

### For Frontend Development (React)
Use these techniques to:
- Create component structures for invoice displays
- Implement data fetching services from invoice APIs
- Design state management for invoice data
- Build responsive UI elements for reviewing invoices

Reference the code lab in the React folder for specific examples of these techniques applied to a telecommunications billing system UI.

## Workshop Instructions

### Option 1: Follow Provided Examples
1. Navigate to either the Java or React code lab folder based on your interest
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions and use the provided prompts
3. Observe how different prompt engineering techniques affect Copilot's output
4. Complete the exercises to build components of an invoice management system

### Option 2: Create Custom Implementation
1. Choose a domain or project type you're interested in (can use the telecommunications billing domain from the examples)
2. Apply the prompt engineering techniques to your specific use case
3. Document the prompts you used and their effectiveness
4. Share your findings with the group

## Success Criteria
Your implementation should demonstrate:
- Effective use of at least two prompt engineering techniques
- Clear improvement in code quality or generation efficiency
- Relevant application to a business domain (such as telecommunications billing)
- Proper documentation of prompts used and their outcomes
