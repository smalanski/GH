### Step 1: Setting Up the Backend Project with Spring Boot
#### Explanation:
Begin by setting up a new Java project using Spring Boot, a popular framework for building production-ready applications with Java. This project will focus on backend logic, API endpoints, and data handling.

#### Tips:
- Use Java 11 or later.
- Use Spring Initializr to bootstrap your project.
- Allow GitHub Copilot to assist in scaffolding the initial project structure.

#### Using Copilot to help with prompt generation:
```bash
"How should I write a prompt if I want to generate the skeleton of a Spring backend service code for: InvoiceController, InvoiceService, InvoiceRepository and Invoice entity using the guidelines listed in feature-requirement.md. Update the pom.xml with the required dependencies."
```

#### Example Output to be used in Copilot Edits mode:
```bash
# Generate Spring Backend Service Skeleton

## Update `pom.xml` with the required dependencies:
- Spring Boot Starter Web
- Spring Boot Starter Data JPA
- H2 Database
- SpringDoc OpenAPI Starter

## Create the following classes:

### Invoice Entity
- Create a JPA entity class named `Invoice` with fields: `id`, `userId`, `amount`, `status`, `createdDate`, `updatedDate`.

### Invoice Repository
- Create a repository interface named `InvoiceRepository` that extends `JpaRepository<Invoice, Long>`.

### Invoice Service
- Create a service class named `InvoiceService` with methods:
  - `List<Invoice> getAllInvoices()`
  - `Invoice getInvoiceById(Long id)`
  - `Invoice createInvoice(Invoice invoice)`
  - `Invoice updateInvoice(Long id, Invoice invoice)`
  - `void deleteInvoice(Long id)`

### Invoice Controller
- Create a REST controller class named `InvoiceController` with endpoints:
  - `GET /invoices` to fetch all invoices
  - `GET /invoices/{id}` to fetch a specific invoice by ID
  - `POST /invoices` to create a new invoice
  - `PUT /invoices/{id}` to update an existing invoice
  - `DELETE /invoices/{id}` to delete an invoice by ID
```

#### Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr ([https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/)).
   - Project: Maven Project
   - Language: Java
   - Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database (for in-memory testing)
   - Java Version: 11 or higher
2. Download the project and import it into your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the `src/main/java` directory to begin coding.

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

#### Prompt for Copilot:
```bash
Prompt 1: Create a new Spring Boot project with Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database dependencies
```

**Tips**:
- Use `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to start your Spring Boot application.
- Ensure Java 11 or later is installed.

### Option A: Prompt Techniques - Chain of Thought
#### Explanation:
Chain of Thought is a prompt engineering technique that helps break down complex tasks into manageable steps.

In this step, you'll guide Copilot to set up foundational components of your backend service, such as controller, service, and repository layers.

#### Step-by-step Instructions:

**Step 1**: Create the main application entry point.
```bash
Prompt 1: Set up a Spring Boot main class to initialize the application
```

**Example Code** (`InvoicingApplication.java`):
```java
package com.invoicing.backend;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class InvoicingApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(InvoicingApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

**Step 2**: Define the Invoice entity model.
```bash
Prompt 2: Create an entity class Invoice with fields id, invoiceNumber, invoiceDate, and totalAmount
```

**Example Code** (`Invoice.java`):
```java
package com.invoicing.backend.model;

import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class Invoice {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String invoiceNumber;
    private Date invoiceDate;
    private Double totalAmount;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

**Step 3**: Create a REST controller for handling invoice data.
```bash
Prompt 3: Create a InvoiceController with GET and POST endpoints for managing invoices
```

**Example Code** (`InvoiceController.java`):
```java
package com.invoicing.backend.controller;

import com.invoicing.backend.model.Invoice;
import com.invoicing.backend.service.InvoiceService;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/invoice")
public class InvoiceController {

    private final InvoiceService invoiceService;

    public InvoiceController(InvoiceService invoiceService) {
        this.invoiceService = invoiceService;
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<Invoice> getAllInvoices() {
        return InvoiceService.getAllInvoices();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Invoice createInvoice(@RequestBody Invoice Invoice) {
        return InvoiceService.saveInvoice(Invoice);
    }

    // Add more endpoints as needed
}
```

#### Tips:
- Use Spring's `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` for creating RESTful endpoints.
- Structure your application using MVC pattern for better maintainability.

### Option B: Prompt Techniques - X-Shot Prompting
#### Explanation:
X-Shot Prompting provides multiple examples to guide Copilot in generating more complex code, improving its predictive capabilities.

#### Step-by-step Instructions:

**Step 1**: Define a JPA repository for Invoice.
```bash
Prompt 1: Create a InvoiceRepository interface extending JpaRepository
```

**Example Code** (`InvoiceRepository.java`):
```java
package com.invoicing.backend.repository;

import com.invoicing.backend.model.Invoice;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface InvoiceRepository extends JpaRepository<Invoice, Long> {
}
```

**Step 2**: Implement the InvoiceService class.
```bash
Prompt 2: Implement a InvoiceService class with methods to save and retrieve Invoices
```

**Example Code** (`InvoiceService.java`):
```java
package com.invoicing.backend.service;

import com.invoicing.backend.model.Invoice;
import com.invoicing.backend.repository.InvoiceRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.List;

@Service
public class InvoiceService {

    private final InvoiceRepository InvoiceRepository;

    public InvoiceService(InvoiceRepository InvoiceRepository) {
        this.InvoiceRepository = InvoiceRepository;
    }

    public List<Invoice> getAllInvoices() {
        return InvoiceRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Invoice saveInvoice(Invoice Invoice) {
        return InvoiceRepository.save(Invoice);
    }
}
```

**Step 3**: Add error handling in the controller.
```bash
Prompt 3: Add exception handling for InvoiceNotFoundException in InvoiceController
```

**Example Code**:
```java
@ExceptionHandler(InvoiceNotFoundException.class)
public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFoundException(InvoiceNotFoundException ex) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
}
```

#### Tips:
- Use `@Service` for business logic and `@Repository` for data access layers.
- Keep prompts clear and concise for effective Copilot suggestions.
